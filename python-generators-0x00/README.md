# Advanced Python Generators & Database Integration

## About the Project

This project explores advanced usage of Python generators to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. The tasks focus on leveraging Python’s `yield` keyword to implement generators that provide iterative access to data, promoting optimal resource utilization and improving performance in data-driven applications.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- **Master Python Generators:** Learn to create and utilize generators for iterative data processing, enabling memory-efficient operations.
- **Handle Large Datasets:** Implement batch processing and lazy loading to work with extensive datasets without overloading memory.
- **Simulate Real-world Scenarios:** Develop solutions to simulate live data updates and apply them to streaming contexts.
- **Optimize Performance:** Use generators to calculate aggregate functions like averages on large datasets, minimizing memory consumption.
- **Apply SQL Knowledge:** Use SQL queries to fetch data dynamically, integrating Python with databases for robust data management.

# How to Run the Project

To run `0-main.py`, you must provide your MySQL connection details as environment variables.  
Use the following command, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

```sh
DB_HOST=<your_host> DB_USER=<your_username> DB_PASSWORD=<your_password> DB_NAME=<your_database> python 0-main.py
```
